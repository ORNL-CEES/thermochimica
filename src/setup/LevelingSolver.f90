    ! Purpose:
    ! ========
    !
    !> \details The purpose of this subroutine is to provide initial estimates of the equilibrium phase
    !! assemblage for the GEMSolver using the "Leveling" technique of Eriksson and Thompson.  The fundamental
    !! principle of the leveling technique is to temporarily assume that all species may be treated as pure
    !! stoichiometric phases.  In more mathematical terms, the mixing terms in the chemical potential
    !! function of a solution species becomes zero and the Gibbs energy of the system becomes a linear function.
    !! The Leveling subroutine can therefore be interpreted as a linear optimizer that provides initial
    !! estimates for the GEMSolver subroutine.
    !!
    !! There are several advantages in employing the Leveling technique:
    !! <ol>
    !! <li> Close estimates are provided for dElementPotential and dChemicalPotential, </li>
    !! <li> An estimate is provided for the phase assemblage, which is often fairly close to the equilibrium
    !!      assemblage (i.e., which phases are expected to be most stable), </li>
    !! <li> The estimated phase assemblage is determined with relatively few iterations, and </li>
    !! <li> Estimates are provided for the mole fractions of all constituents in all solution phases. </li>
    !! </ol>

    ! Pertinent variables:
    ! ====================
    !
    ! INFOThermo            An integer scalar indicating a successful exit (0) or an error that is
    !                        encountered.
    ! nElements             The number of elements in the system.
    ! iAssemblage           Integer vector containing the indices of species (temporarily treated as pure
    !                        stoichiometric phases) estimated to be part of the equilibrium phase
    !                        assemblage.
    ! iSpeciesTotalAtoms    An integer vector representing the total number of atoms per formula mass of
    !                        a particular species.
    ! dMolesPhase           Number of moles of a phase at equilibrium
    ! dMolesElement         Total number of moles of an element (normalized for numerical purposes).
    ! dLevel                The adjustment applied to the element potentials as a result of leveling.
    ! dChemicalPotential    A double real vector representing the chemical potential of each species and
    !                        pure condensed phase.  This variable is numerical adjusted and represented
    !                        with respect to the element potentials.
    ! dElementPotential     The chemical potentals of the pure elements.
    ! dTolerance            A double real vector representing numerical tolerances (defined in
