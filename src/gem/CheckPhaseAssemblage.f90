    !   03/31/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Original code.
    !   07/31/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Clean up code: remove unnecessary variables, update variable names.
    !   09/14/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Modified strategy for adding solution phases to the assemblage and
    !                                        when a phase should swap for another phase.
    !   09/22/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Added the capability to revert back to the last previous phase
    !                                        assemblage when a solution phase should be removed, but can't because
    !                                        it will yield an inappropriate Jacobian.
    !   09/23/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Added the SortAssemblage subroutine to provide a good first estimate
    !                                        of a pure condensed phase to be replaced by either a new phase.
    !                                        Care of Delta Flight 238.
    !   10/26/2011      M.H.A. Piro         Clean up code: modules, fragment code into multiple subroutines.
    !   01/05/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Created the SwapSolnPhase subroutine.
    !   01/19/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Added the capability to swap a pure condensed phase for a solution
    !                                        phase.
    !   02/08/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Modified algorithm for adding a solution phase: the order that
    !                                        solution phases are considered to be added to the system are in
    !                                        descending order of the sum of their hypothetical mole fractions.
    !   02/10/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Added the capability to test a phase assemblage that is now entirely
    !                                        comprised of pure condensed phases.
    !   02/11/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Added the condition that the change to the number of moles of a pure
    !                                        condensed phase must be non-positive to remove this phase from the
    !                                        system.
    !   02/28/2012      M.H.A. Piro         If a pure condensed phase could not be removed from the system but a
    !                                        different pure condensed phase should be added, then try swapping the
    !                                        two.
    !   04/05/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Clean up code by creating four separate subroutines:
    !                                        CheckPureConPhaseRem, CheckPureConPhaseAdd, CheckSolnPhaseRem,
    !                                        CheckSolnPhaseAdd
    !   04/26/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Implementing Gibbs energy Minimization algorithm and dOxygen.
    !   06/11/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Change order of calls: check if either phase should be removed first,
    !                                        then adding a phase as opposed to pure con remove, pure con add,
    !                                        soln rem, soln add.
    !   07/04/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Only allow a phase to be added to the system when the system is
    !                                        predicted to be stagnant (happy Independence Day).
    !   09/23/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Check whether CheckPureConPhaseAdd should be called before
    !                                        CheckSolnPhaseAdd or vice versa.
    !   09/24/2012      M.H.A. Piro         Do not update the driving force of a solution phase in this subroutine
    !                                        right after it has been calculated in CheckConvergence.
    !   10/19/2012      M.H.A. Piro         If the system has not changed in 50 iterations and the functional
    !                                        norm is greater than 1000, then the system is reverted to the last
    !                                        phase assemblage.  If the last phase change was reverted, then
    !                                        you would be in a continuous loop.  Revert to the first assemblage.
    !   03/18/2013      M.H.A. Piro         Previously, the RevertSystem subroutine is called if the functional
    !                                        norm is above 1000 and 50 iterations have passed since the phase
    !                                        assemblage has changed.  An additional constraint is imposed to this
    !                                        scenario that requires the functional norm to be changing by less than
    !                                        1%.
    !   04/9/2013       M.H.A. Piro         If a previously called subroutine says that the system needs to be
    !                                        reverted, but the system has never changed, nothing will happen.
    !                                        Now, the CorrectStagnation subroutine is called for this scenario
    !                                        which tries to remove a pure condensed phase from the system.
    !
    !
    ! Purpose:
    ! ========
    !
    !> \details The purpose of this subroutine is to check whether a phase should be added to, removed from, or
    !! swap another phase currently in the estimated phase assemblage and to perform any necessary action.  The
    !! conditions for adding or removing a phase from the assemblage follow:
    !!
    !! <ol>
    !! <li> Remove a pure condensed phase when the number of moles of that phase is negative, </li>
    !! <li> Remove a solution phase when the number of moles of that phase is less than a specified tolernace,
    !!       </li>
    !! <li> Add a pure condensed phase when the driving force is negative, </li>
    !! <li> Add a solution phase when the sum of all mole fractions within the phase is greater than unity.
    !!       An equivalent statement is that the driving force of this phase is negative. </li>
    !! </ol>
    !!
    !! To prevent contradicting the Gibbs Phase Rule (i.e., the maximum number of phases is equal to the number of
    !! elements when temperature and pressure are constant), a phase replaces another phase when the number of
    !! phases already in the system equals the number  of elements.  The phase assemblage is not checked every
    !! iteration to give the numerical solution a chance to converge.
    !!
    !! The main subroutines used by this solver are summarized below:

    ! iterLast              An integer scalar representing the last global iteration that resulted in a change
    !                        in the estimated phase assemblage.  This variable will be updated when the phase
    !                        assemblage changes.
    ! iterRevert            An integer scalar representing the last global iteration that resulted in reverting

    ! iterHistory           An integer matrix representing the indices of phases in the system that have been
    !                        previously considered in the iteration history.
    ! iAssemblage           An integer vector representing the indices of phases currently estimated to be stable.
    ! dMolesPhaseChange     A double real scalar representing the tolerance for the relative change of the number
    !                        of moles of a solution phase.
