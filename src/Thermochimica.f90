!! \section     Introduction
!!
!!          The purpose of Thermochimica is to compute the quantities of species
!!          and phases at thermodynamic equilibrium and various other
!!          thermodynamic quantities.  For a detailed discussion on numerical
!!          methods employed in this work and the principles of computational
!!          thermodynamics, refer to the following literature:

!!            399-407.
!!
!!          The required input variables include:
!!          - dTemperature: double real scalar, represents temperature;
!!          - dPressure: double real scalar, represents absolute hydrostatic
!!             pressure;
!!          - dElementMass: double real vector [0:118], represents mass of each
!!             chemical element;
!!          - cThermoInputUnits: character vector [1:3], represents the units of
!!             the input variables;
!!          - cThermoFileName: character scalar, represents data-file path and
!!             name.
!!
!!          Useful information that Thermochimica provides as output include:
!!          - the identification of phases predicted to be stable at equilibrium
!!             (i.e., iAssemblage);
!!          - the number of moles (i.e., dMolesPhase) and the mole fraction
!!             (i.e., dMolFraction) of each solution phase constituent;
!!          - the number of moles of each pure condensed phase
!!             (i.e., dMolesPhase);
!!          - the chemical potentials of all species and phases
!!             (i.e., dChemicalPotential); and
!!          - the chemical potentials of the component elements
!!             (i.e., dElementPotential).
!!
!!          Thermochimica returns the variable INFOThermo (scalar integer)
!!          indictating a successful computation or an error that has been
!!          identified.  A description of each possible value of INFOThermo is
!!          given in the ThermoDebug.f90 subroutine.
!!
!!          Any suggestions to improve documentation and/or programming are
!!          always welcome and appreciated. Please send all suggestions to
!!          Markus Piro at piromh@ornl.gov or markuspiro@gmail.com.

!! \section     Overview
!!
!!          Thermochimica is written in Fortran using the F90/F03 standard.
!!          There are two calls required to make use of this library: 1) a call
!!          to the data-file parser (i.e., ParseCSDataFile.f90), and 2) a call
!!          to Thermochimica (i.e., Thermochimica.f90).  See thermo.f90 for an
!!          example wrapper executable that calls the parser and Thermochimica
!!          with input variables described above.  Finally, both the parser and
!!          Thermochimica are reset by calling ResetThermoAll.f90.
!!
!!          The main subroutines called by ParseCSDataFile.f90 are as follows:
!!
